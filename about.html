			<h2 class="bio-title">Meet Billy</h2>
			<p>Billy’s love for Halloween started early. He would watch his parents set out little decorations every October and get inspired. Eventually, he and his brother took over, turning the yard into something bigger and spookier each year. Their first “big” year was 2010, and the haunt has only grown wilder and more creative every year.</p>

			<p>The haunt is split into three playful sections: Family Friendly, Clowns, and Harvest. Halloween has always been Billy’s favorite holiday, and he spends the whole month getting everything ready. He makes all the props and decorations himself and keeps things fresh by adding popular characters each year.</p>

			<p>Don’t forget to look for the funny tombstones hidden around. They are a little treat for visitors with a sense of humor. Putting the haunt together is a family affair, with help from his mom, dad, and brother Dave. The biggest challenge is time. There is never enough to do everything he dreams up.</p>

			<p>Over the years, there have been plenty of unforgettable moments, like scaring someone so badly they ran into a parked car! Safety is always a priority, so a fence keeps visitors from wandering into the setup unexpectedly. Attendance grows every year, too many to count, and the haunt also gives back to the community with a food drive for the Bellmore-Merrick Food Pantry.</p>

			<p>Billy is always building and adding new surprises, so every Halloween brings something fun, spooky, and completely new for everyone to enjoy.</p>
